User Stories
● As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I
can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.
● As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.

Key Features
● Your app should display a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an
account.
● Once authenticated, the user should now view all movies.
● Upon clicking on a particular movie, users will be taken to a single movie view, where
additional movie details will be displayed. The single movie view will contain the following
additional features:
○ A button that when clicked takes a user to the director view, where details about the
director of that particular movie will be displayed.
○ A button that when clicked takes a user to the genre view, where details about that
particular genre of the movie will be displayed.

Technical Requirements
● The application must be written in Angular (version 9 or later)
● The application requires the latest version of Node.js and npm package
● The application must contain user registration and login forms
● The application must be designed using Angular Material
● The application's codebase must contain comments using Typedoc
● The project must contain technical documentation using JSDoc
● The project must be hosted on GitHub Pages

Your Project Deliverables
You’ll complete your project step-by-step as you work through each Exercise. For each task, you’ll
submit a deliverable that directly contributes to the final product—in this case, an Angular version of
the myFlix app with all the necessary documentation. Furthermore, you'll update your personal
portfolio website that you'll need to apply for a job.

Below is a breakdown of your course project deliverables by Exercise:

Exercise 1: Collaboration and Project Management
● Set up a kanban board that you’ll use as you work on this Achievement's project
● Create a user flow for your project
● Practice answering non-technical interview questions
Throughout this Achievement, you’ll be asked to keep your kanban board up to date. Make sure to
work with your kanban board for each task, and take some time to reflect on your project planning and
assumptions. Were your tasks well broken down and your story points accurate? If not, what could
you improve? By doing this, you can practice your various Agile skills.

Exercise 2: Introduction to Angular
● Create an app using Angular CLI
● Practice answering technical interview questions

Exercise 3: Advanced Angular Part 1
● Implement user registration and login forms using Angular Material
● Practice answering technical interview questions

Exercise 4: Advanced Angular Part 2
● Implement a movie card component in your app
● Define the routing in your app
● Practice answering technical interview questions

Exercise 5: Documentation & Handoffs
● Comment on the app's codebase
● Prepare all the necessary documentation for the app
● Finalize kanban board

Exercise 6: Providing Constructive Feedback
● Review a given screen design and provide constructive feedback
● Finalize portfolio preparation
● Practice answering non-technical and technical interview questions

Exercise 7: Contributing to the Tech Community & Beyond
● Join online and offline developer communities
● Incorporate your projects into your portfolio site

# MyFlixAngularClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.

## Development server

Run `npm start` which will run a script:  `ng serve --port 8080` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
